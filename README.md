## Metadata
In Next.js, metadata for each page is dynamically set using the Head component from next/head. Hereâ€™s an example of how metadata is set:
```javascript
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Latest Posts</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Browse our latest posts" />
      </Head>
      <h1>Welcome back!</h1>
      <p>Here's what you might've missed.</p>
    </>
  );
}
```
This approach ensures that each page can have a unique title and description, which helps with SEO.

## Image Optimization
Next.js offers built-in image optimization with the next/image component, which automatically optimizes images for better performance.

Example usage:
```javascript
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Post({ image, title }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <Image src={image} alt={title} width={500} height={300} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
The next/image component automatically serves images in the best format and size for the user's device, reducing load times.
